# Dalis-Dreamscape

Dali's Dreamscape is an innovative project that seeks to combine the power of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence to create a CNC plotter that can create complex patterns and forensic sketches. The project is being developed as part of a Bachelor of Technology program and aims to provide students with hands-on experience in cutting-edge technologies such as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. The project will involve designing and building a CNC plotter that is capable of producing intricate designs and patterns using a combination of Machine Learning algorithms and Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software.

The plotter will be powered by a Raspberry Pi, Arduino microController enabled with the state of the art Deep Learning, which will serve as the brain of the system, and will be equipped with a User Interface (Webpage) that will allow it to interact with the environment and create designs and sketches that are both aesthetically pleasing and technically precise. The project will draw on a range of cutting-edge technologies, including Deep Learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Diffusion models, which will be used to train the plotter to recognize and reproduce complex patterns, designs and sketches. The plotter will also incorporate advanced image processing techniques, such as edge detection and image segmentation, to enhance its ability to create precise and detailed designs

This repository contains information details to a CNC Plotter powered by Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence named Daliâ€™s DreamScape. The main aim of the project is Forensic Sketch Generation using text prompts. Dali's Dreamscape is a project that combines modern deep learning techniques like GANs and diffusion models with Computer Numerical Control (CNC) technology to create a CNC plotter that can draw forensic sketches.
